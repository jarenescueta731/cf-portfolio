### technical requirements (as supplied by 301 class)
##### class 01
- Be sure to use proper viewport settings.
- Use mobile-first design principles when adding CSS.
- Add new styles in any media queries as needed to make the page look good on desktop screens.  

##### class 02
- Think of some ideas for your source data, and code it up in its own file! Build out an array of three objects to start with, all having similar properties.
- Create a new .js file with the appropriate methods to help modify your source data to help render it to the DOM:
Use good Object Oriented code: Create a constructor function for projects or source data.
- Leave as little in the window (global) namespace as possible: attach functions to objects, etc.
- Use jQuery to clone the example markup for each project, as you add additional content.
Your "Project" prototype should have a .toHtml() function that adds new data to the DOM.
- Refactor your CSS into a base, layout, and module structure where applicable.
